}

Essa semana a quantidade de conteúdo deu uma diminuida, talvez devido ao Diversão Offline (#doff) que aconteceu nesse fim-de-semana.

No geral, porém, ainda tivemos muito conteúdo interessante. Ao meu ver, uma muito bacana é que a WotC teve receiva superior a 58 milhões de dólares ano passado. Indicando que a empresa anda relativamente bem e recupernando (ou recuperada) da falência da ToyRUs.

Outra notícia muito boa é o futuro lançamento do RPG baseado na franquia de filmes Alien, relacionado aos 40 anos da mesma. O jogo será lançado pela Free League, a mesma criadora de Things from the Flood and Tales from the Loop. Vale lembrar, porém, que o Brasil já tem o seu com O Abismo, do John Bogéa =)

E mais uma notícia boa é o do financiamento coletivo "Fate of Cthulhu", uma adaptação do Mythos para o sitema Fate!

Pois bem, fiquem com os links e até a próxima!
