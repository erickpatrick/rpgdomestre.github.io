#### Dicas Internacionais (via Twitter)

- [Always be learning.] <small>(SlyFlourish)</small>
- [Stay in the fiction. Describe what's happening in the world.] <small>(SlyFlourish)</small>
- [What drives the characters to dive into your adventure? Why do they care? What do they want?] <small>(SlyFlourish)</small>
- [Remind players to leave gaps in their backstories so they can grow into their characters as the adventures move onward.] <small>(SlyFlourish)</small>
- [Mash the defining traits of one stat block with another to build something completely unique. Ghoul assassin! Stone giant lich! Goblin veteran! Pick one for base stats and steal defining traits from another.] <small>(SlyFlourish)</small>
- [Teach your kids how to play! They learn about teamwork, math, consequences, vocabulary, problem solving and critical thinking. And just for the record, their imaginations are amazing!] <small>(Grand_DM)</small>
- [DMs, want to let the PCs rest but have an encounter? Try nightmares with initiative. If the PC drops to 0 HP during the nightmare, they awaken and rest is ruined.] <small>(Grand_DM)</small>
- [DMs, two heads are better than one. For a unique challenge double up! Two-headed Medusa, Vampire, Rust Monster, etc.] <small>(Grand_DM)</small>
- [Different players have different "types." Countless articles and books are written on the subject. I'm going to try to distill it down into pieces. We have to start with one premise. These types exist in some way, and DMs can play to those types.] <small>(shawnmerwin)</small>
- [the DMG identifies 7 player types: actor, explorer, instigator, fighter, optimizer, problem solver, and storyteller. Most players are a mixture of these, and we could use other monikers. Every way, there are ways to appeal to each of these types.] <small>(shawnmerwin)</small>
- [if you get to choose your players and have the time, spend a session (often called session 0) talking about the campaign you want to run, and they can tell you about their preferences and expectations. If not, things are a little trickier!] <small>(shawnmerwin)</small>
- [Write down a short list of the important parts you need to pass along when describing narrative histories.] <small>(DnDTweets)</small>
- [Just because the players forgot something does not mean their characters would, or even could. Adventurers are a cut above, give them the benefit of the doubt when it comes to information. The game is better when players make informed decisions.] <small>(TempestLOB)</small>
